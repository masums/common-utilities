# Common Utilities
Common utilities contains some stuff that can be reused for any project.
It is not yet to become some NuGet(s), but more of sharing how I managed some of the problems I ran into.

Distributed cache is great as it is shared between servers, but it is slower.

This code shows you how you can combine those two to get besto of both worlds.
